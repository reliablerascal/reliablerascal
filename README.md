### Hello!ðŸ‘‹
I am one of thousands of **Rob Reids** on the planet,<br>
but if you want to be specific you can call me **Reliable Rascal**, my GitHub name. 
<hr>
<p>As someone who loves both <strong>narrative</strong> and <strong>numbers</strong> I lived a split existence for most of my life as a social service database developer and writer-on-the side. But now I'm a proper freelance data journalist. 

<p>These days (winter 2024) I'm balancing several gigs, including documenting public meetings and <strong>fact-checking</strong> for <a href="https://www.documenters.org/">City Bureau</a>, and <strong>writing freelance articles</strong> for local Chicago news outlets. I'm about to start new work <strong>scraping elections data</strong> for the Associated Press. 

<p>You can find my journalism portfolio at <a href="https://reliablerascal.github.io/">https://reliablerascal.github.io/</a>, but here you'll find some of my Javascript/QGIS mapping and data wrangling work:
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/data-liberation-project/tsa-complaint-counts">TSA complaints data pipeline</a></strong>- my collaborative contribution to the <a href="https://www.data-liberation-project.org/">Data Liberation Project</a>
  <li><strong>Divvy bikeshare data pipelines</strong> to explore <a href="https://github.com/reliablerascal/divvy-winter/tree/main/notebooks">ridership patterns<a> and <a href="https://github.com/reliablerascal/divvy-performance">station bike availability</a>
    <li><strong>Map-based scrollytelling stories</strong> about <a href="https://github.com/reliablerascal/fort-washington">access to Fort Washington Park</a> and <a href="https://github.com/reliablerascal/bike-far-southeast"?Chicago's Southeast Side wetland parks</a>
      <li><strong>Wrangling Public and FOIA-acquired data sets</strong>, including <a href="https://github.com/reliablerascal/911-mental-mindsite">911 call data related to mental health crises</a>.
</ul>

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with news outlets and these and similar types of data wrangling and mapping projects.
