### Hello!ðŸ‘‹
I am one of the thousands of **Rob Reids** on the planet. But if you want to be specific, you can call me **Reliable Rascal**, my GitHub name. 

As someone who loves **narrative** and **numbers** and **civic empowerment**, I've recently rolled all three into a coherent career as the Education Data Developer for **Texas Tribune**.

Here you'll find some of my data wrangling work from 2023-2024, predating my time at the Tribune:
* Contributed to the development of the **Jacksonville Tributary's** [legislative voting dashboard](https://jaxtrib.shinyapps.io/Legislative_Compass/) by developing a streamlined  **[ETL pipeline](https://github.com/reliablerascal/fl-legislation-etl)** and contributing to development of the **[legislator dashboard](https://github.com/reliablerascal/fl-legislation-app-postgres)**
* **Wrangled/transformed/analyzed public and FOIA-acquired data sets** about <a href="https://github.com/reliablerascal/snow-clearance">snow clearance and fines for unshoveled sidewalks</a>
* Divvy bikeshare data pipelines</strong> to explore <a href="https://github.com/reliablerascal/divvy-winter/tree/main/notebooks">ridership patterns<a> and <a href="https://github.com/reliablerascal/divvy-performance">station bike availability</a>
* **Map-based scrollytelling stories** about <a href="https://github.com/reliablerascal/fort-washington">access to Fort Washington Park</a> and <a href="https://github.com/reliablerascal/bike-far-southeast">Chicago's Southeast Side wetland parks</a>
* My collaborative contribution to developing the **<a href="https://github.com/data-liberation-project/tsa-complaint-counts">TSA complaints data pipeline</a>** with the <a href="https://www.data-liberation-project.org/">Data Liberation Project</a>.
