### Hello!ðŸ‘‹
I am one of thousands of **Rob Reids** on the planet,<br>
but if you want to be specific you can call me **Reliable Rascal**, my GitHub name. 
<hr>
<p>As someone who loves both <strong>narrative</strong> and <strong>numbers</strong> I lived a split existence for most of my life as a social service database developer and writer-on-the side. But now I'm a proper freelance data journalist. 

<p>These days (winter 2024) I'm balancing several gigs: documenting public meetings and <strong>fact-checking</strong> for <a href="https://www.documenters.org/">City Bureau</a>, <strong>writing freelance articles</strong> for local Chicago news outlets, and I'm about to start new work <strong>scraping elections data</strong> for the Associated Press. 

<p>You can find my journalism portfolio at <a href="https://reliablerascal.github.io/">https://reliablerascal.github.io/</a>, but here you'll find some of my Javascript/QGIS mapping and data wrangling work:
<ul>
<li>Collaborative contribution to the <a href="https://www.data-liberation-project.org/">Data Liberation Project</a> on creating a <a href="https://github.com/data-liberation-project/tsa-complaint-counts">pipeline of TSA complaints data</a>
  <li>Pipelines of Divvy bikeshare data to explore <a href="https://github.com/reliablerascal/divvy-winter/tree/main/notebooks">ridership patterns<a> and <a href="https://github.com/reliablerascal/divvy-performance">station bike availability</a>
    <li>**map-based scrollytelling stories** about <a href="https://github.com/reliablerascal/fort-washington">access to Fort Washington Park</a> and <a href="https://github.com/reliablerascal/bike-far-southeast"?Chicago's Southeast Side wetland parks</a>.
</ul>
