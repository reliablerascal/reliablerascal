### Hello!ðŸ‘‹
I am one of the thousands of **Rob Reids** on the planet. But if you want to be specific, you can call me **Reliable Rascal**, my GitHub name. 

<p>As someone who loves <strong>narrative</strong> and <strong>numbers</strong> and <strong>civic media</strong>, I've recently found a way to roll all three into a coherent career as a data journalist. 

<p>These days (summer 2024) I'm working as a data journalist intern at the <strong>Jacksonville Tributary</strong>. Prior to that I'd balanced several freelance gigs, <strong>fact-checking</strong> and documenting public meetings for <a href="https://www.documenters.org/">City Bureau</a>, scraping election night results, and <a href="https://reliablerascal.github.io/">writing freelance articles</a>.

For my Tributary internship, I've been slowly and steadily automating, streamlining, and documenting an existing data pipeline and interactive <strong><a href="https://github.com/topics/legislative-dashboard">legislative voting patterns dashboard</a></strong>.
  
  <p>And here you'll find some of my prior freelance data wrangling work:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Wrangled/transformed/analyzed public and FOIA-acquired data sets</strong> about <a href="https://github.com/reliablerascal/snow-clearance">snow clearance and fines for unshoveled sidewalks</a>
  <li><strong>Divvy bikeshare data pipelines</strong> to explore <a href="https://github.com/reliablerascal/divvy-winter/tree/main/notebooks">ridership patterns<a> and <a href="https://github.com/reliablerascal/divvy-performance">station bike availability</a>
    <li><strong>Map-based scrollytelling stories</strong> about <a href="https://github.com/reliablerascal/fort-washington">access to Fort Washington Park</a> and <a href="https://github.com/reliablerascal/bike-far-southeast">Chicago's Southeast Side wetland parks</a>
<li>My collaborative contribution to developing the <a href="https://github.com/data-liberation-project/tsa-complaint-counts">TSA complaints data pipeline</a> with the <a href="https://www.data-liberation-project.org/">Data Liberation Project</a>.
</ul>
<!--
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with news outlets on these and similar types of data wrangling and mapping projects.
