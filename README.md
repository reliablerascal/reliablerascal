### Hello!üëã
I am one of millions of **Robs** and one of thousands of **Rob Reids** on the planet,<br>
but if you want to be specific you can call me by my GitHub name, **Reliable Rascal**. 
<hr>
<p>As someone who loves both **narrative** and **numbers** I've lived a split existence for most of my life, but now I'm a proper freelance data journalist. 

<p>These days (winter 2024) I'm balancing several gigs: documenting public meetings and fact-checking for <a href="https://www.documenters.org/">City Bureau</a>, writing articles for local Chicago news outlets, and I'm about to start new work scraping elections data for the Associated Press. 

<p>You can find my journalism portfolio at <a href="https://reliablerascal.github.io/">https://reliablerascal.github.io/</a>, but here you'll find some of my Javascript/QGIS mapping and data wrangling work.

I collaboratively worked with the <a href="https://www.data-liberation-project.org/">Data Liberation Project</a> on creating a <a href="https://github.com/data-liberation-project/tsa-complaint-counts">pipeline of TSA complaints data</a>. I've been building pipelines of Divvy bikeshare data to explore <a href="https://github.com/reliablerascal/divvy-winter/tree/main/notebooks">ridership patterns<a> and <a href="https://github.com/reliablerascal/divvy-performance">station bike availability</a>. map-based scrollytelling stories about <a href="https://github.com/reliablerascal/fort-washington">access to Fort Washington Park</a> and <a href="https://github.com/reliablerascal/bike-far-southeast"?Chicago's Southeast Side wetland parks</a>.

(and a separate pipeline for station-level data to discuss another time) to start answering those kinds of questions- stitching together twelve months on data into one dataset, parsing dates, doing a ‚Äúspatial join‚Äù to align with Chicago geographical boundaries.
