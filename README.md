### Hello!ðŸ‘‹
I am one of millions of **Robs** and one of thousands of **Rob Reids** on the planet,<br>
but if you want to be specific you can call me by my GitHub name, **Reliable Rascal**. 
<hr>
As someone who loves both narrative and numbers I've lived a split existence for most of my life, but now I'm a proper freelance data journalist.

You can find my journalism portfolio at <a href="https://reliablerascal.github.io/">https://reliablerascal.github.io/</a>, but here you'll find some of my data wrangling work.
